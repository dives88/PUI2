HW7_dhi211

This is the readme for HW7.



I worked with Imran and Srikanth on this assignment. 


Assignment 1: Srikanth did the coding for rthe month of January (HW7_1_JANDATA.ipynb) and determined the T-Test was the best test to run. I was unable to recieve any feedback from a classmate. I think this is due to ongoing github issues. In the notebook attached to this assignment, I ran the T-Test for the month of July 2017 (HW7_dhi211.ipynb) with some guidance from Srikanth. 



Assignment 2: I started the write up with Imran finishing it and Srikanth providing input. Our document is attached in PDF form, or can be found here: https://www.authorea.com/210947/1TFOO9JcPyG635su70csNw


Assingment 3: I worked with Imran and Srikanth on this assignment.
