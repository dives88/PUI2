###CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?

- I found this easy to decipher what was trying to be conveyed - warmer colors correspond to higher number of fatalities; cooler colors to fewer fatalities. 
Locations where the most events occurred correspond to the description of the image as well.

[Recommendation] 
- Values needed on the label to understand the magnitude of fatalities for each icon. I would like to know how big of an issue each icon on the map is and how many fatalities it corresponds to. 
Plotting major bicycle routes or other geographic assets on top of the heat maps could also provide more definition to where these incidents are occurring. Future study could investigate other geographic features where fatalities occur, for example, where highways meet local roads, or busy intersections, to name two examples.

###ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?
- Colors are nice and simple - this is good.
- Itâ€™s good that the geography of NYC can clearly be seen.


###HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
- I think the data is honestly displaying the available data. It is helpful to see in which parts of the city cycling fatalities are appearing. A more detailed legend would give more detail to this picture.
